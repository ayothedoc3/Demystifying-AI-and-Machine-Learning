# Demystifying AI and Machine Learning
From Python to Real-World Applications

**Ayokunle Ademola-John**

---
## Why this matters
- Real value comes from decisions, not models
- Small, clear wins beat complex demos

---
## Map of the field
- AI, ML, Deep Learning
- Data → Features → Model → Metrics → Deploy

---
## The 15 minute baseline
- Load data
- Split train and test
- Train logistic regression
- Report accuracy and one risk

---
## Live demo plan
- Iris classification in scikit-learn
- Text sentiment with bag-of-words
- Questions from the room

---
## Common mistakes
- No test set
- Optimizing the wrong metric
- Data leakage
- Ignoring simple baselines

---
## Responsible use
- Bias and fairness basics
- Privacy and consent
- Human in the loop

---
## Your next step
- Start with a decision and a metric
- Ship a baseline this week
- Iterate with users
